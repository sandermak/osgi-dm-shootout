================

Code accompanying the talk 'The Ultimate Dependency Manager Shoot-out'. This repository has two main purposes:

- Compare OSGi dependency managers (Declarative Services, Felix DM, Blueprint, Felix iPojo) by creating a small sample app in each framework
- Benchmark these dependency managers (see ```benchmark```) folder.

All projects are BndTools projects and can be imported into an Eclipse installation with BndTools.
